# 86Box-Templates

A bunch of templates for the emulator 86Box, they're tested ALWAYS using the latest 86box build (beta buils and stable)

I personally test all created machines with different OS, but also I accept suggestions

My (current) machine:

- Asus Prime Z270-P MOtherboard
- Intel i7-7700k 4.20 Ghz CPU
- Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x8 GB DDR4 3200 Mhz RAM (Dual Channel)
- 2x480 GB Kioxia Exceria SSD SATA Drives and 2 TB Seagate barracuda SATA HDD
- Windows 11 Pro Operative System (Latest Build)
