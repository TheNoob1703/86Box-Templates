# 86Box-Templates

A bunch of templates for the emulator 86Box, they're tested ALWAYS using the latest 86box build (beta builds and stable builds)

I personally test all created machines with different OS, but also I accept suggestions

Check template to create your machine

My (current) machine:

- Asus Prime B550-A CSM Motherboard
- AMD Ryzen 7 5700G 3.80 (4.6 Turbo) Ghz CPU
- Corsair Vengeance LPX 4x8 GB DDR4 3200 Mhz RAM (Dual Channel Mixed)
- 1TB SATA SSD Silicon Power, 480 GB Kioxia Exceria SSD SATA Drives and 2 TB Seagate barracuda SATA HDD
- Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021
